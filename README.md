# Belonging

Belonging is a game about a guy who has led his whole life underground in an abandoned mine. The game follows his exodus to find a sense of belonging, as his polychromic sprite sets him out of place in his monochrome environment.

## Mechanics

Belonging has several mechanics that the player can interface with, such as:

Moving left and right
Jumping
Bouncing on mushrooms and such


## Aesthetics

The game has dynamic lighting and spacial sound! that's worth noting for sure.

other than that, it looks alright.


### Dev's feelings

Jauss:

I had a lot of fun refining the movement and animation systems. I also experienced a lot of grief working on the movement and animation systems. After that was done, I'm happy that I was able to kick back and make a little environment for the menu screen.

Leigh:

I enjoyed building the world and testing out the gameplay. I had to ensure that everything was possible, and I even had a couple of friends test it for me. The time contstraints on this project stressed me out more than some of the others I've worked on.
